## 💬 Introduction

Have you ever wondered how much time do you spend **_actually_** coding?\
This extension counts time spending on doing your actual job instead of checking out reddit or instagram.

## ⚙️ How does it works?

1. Install the extension in `vscode`
2. Set up a delay in configuration or leave it as default `(5s)`
   - This setting is responsible for the amount of time it takes to freeze your counter after last code change
3. Every time you modify any document in `vscode` delay is reset and the counter keeps increasing
4. When idle for enough time (haven't done any modification) the counter stops counting.

The goal of this tool is to show you how much time do you spend actually coding - eg. how much time do you press your keys to modify code. The timer won't be resumed when using build-in console etc, only when you modify any file - type new characters, remove them, save the file, copy, paste etc.
