## üí¨ Introduction

Have you ever wondered how much time do you spend **_actually_** coding?\
This extension counts time spending on doing your actual job instead of checking out reddit or instagram.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it works?

1. Install the extension in `vscode`
2. Set up a delay in configuration or leave it as default `(5s)`
   - This setting is responsible for the amount of time it takes to freeze your counter after last code change
3. Every time you modify any document in `vscode` delay is reset and the timer keeps increasing
4. When idle for enough time (haven't done any modification) the timer stops counting.
5. Specify persistance settings
   - Keep data between coding session
   - Clear persisted data on a day-to-day basis
   - Do not persist data at all

**_The goal of this tool is to show you how much time do you spend actually coding_** \
 The timer won't be resumed simply by using `vscode`\
You can resume it by

- Modifying any file
- Changing any character
- Copying and pasting
- Saving the file
- etc.
